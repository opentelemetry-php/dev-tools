## Release Management

A tool to find unreleased changes for OpenTelemetry, create new releases with release notes.

### Requirements

You need to be an administrator/owner of [opentelemetry-php](https://github.com/opentelemetry-php) to actually create releases. A lower-privileged account
should be able to do everything else, but will fail if you try to create a release.

You need to [create a fine-grained github access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) to be able to create a release.

For everything under `opentelemetry-php` (almost everything, ie the gitsplit destination):
* resource owner: `opentelemetry-php`
* repository access: `all repositories`
* permissions: `contents:read-and-write`

For `opentelemetry-php-instrumentation` (the extension):
* resouce owner: `open-telemetry`
* repository access: (only selected) `open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-instrumentation`
* permissions: `contents:read-and-write`

You can provide the token either via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var (preferred), or the `--token=` CLI option.

### Usage

```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<fine-grain-access-token>
bin/otel release:run -[vvv] [--token=token] [--branch=main] [--dry-run] [--repo=<core|contrib>]
```

Options:
- `-v[vv]` - verbosity
- `--token=` - github token (can also be passed by `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- `--branch=` - github branch to tag from
- `--dry-run` - do not make any changes
- `--repo=` - choose a single upstream repo to run against (default: all)

The script will then:
* fetch `.gitsplit.yaml` from source repositories
* process yaml to determine downstream (read-only) repositories and their path association in upstream (eg open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php:/src/API -> opentelemetry-php/api)
* find latest release in downstream
* find changes in upstream newer than the latest release, and their associated pull request
* retrieve diffs from downstream between latest tag and chosen branch (eg main)
* check that upstream changes match downstream diffs

Once all the info has been gathered, it will iterate over each repo with unreleased changes. For each repo:
* list the changes
* display the last release version, and ask for new version
* ask if new release should be latest
* ask if the new release should be a draft (eg so you can manually adjust the notes)
* generate release notes
* create the release (unless `--dry-run` was specified)

## PECL release tool

A tool to fetch and update package.xml, for a new version of the opentelemetry extension on PECL.

```shell
bin/otel release:pecl
```

Options:
- `-v[vv]` - verbosity
- `--force` - add a new version even if no changes detected

The script will then:
* fetch latest release
* fetch all commits newer than last release
* fetch `package.xml`
* prompt for next version number
* move existing version details into a new `release` in `<changelog>`
* update XML with new version details
* write updated `package.xml` to console

Manual steps:
1. copy/paste XML into `package.xml`
2. open in IDE to check for/fix formatting and invalid XML (invalid chars should have been converted)
3. update `php_opentelemetry.h` version info to match new version# (look for `PHP_OPENTELEMETRY_VERSION`)
4. submit a PR (`package.xml` + `php_opentelemetry.h`) back to [opentelemetry-php-instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-instrumentation)
5. get approval and merge PR
6. tag next release: `bin/otel tag:pecl`
7. wait for github workflow to run, eyeball it, then publish it
8. download and unzip the `opentelemetry-pecl` artifact from the release (containing `opentelemetry-<version>.tar.gz`)
9. upload `opentelemetry-<version>.tar.gz` to pecl: https://pecl.php.net/release-upload.php
10. verify (install via pecl)
